---

## Code Architecture and Patterns

### Movement System
```gml
// Input handling (following The Wizard conventions)
right_key = keyboard_check(ord("D"));
left_key = keyboard_check(ord("A"));
jump_key = keyboard_check_pressed(ord("W"));

// Update facing direction
if (right_key) facing_direction = 1;
if (left_key) facing_direction = -1;

// Horizontal movement
h_speed = (right_key - left_key) * move_speed;
```

### Physics System
```gml
// Apply gravity
v_speed += gravity_force;

// Reset ground state when moving upward (jumping/falling up)
if (v_speed < 0) {
    is_on_ground = false;
}

// Jump when on ground
if (jump_key && is_on_ground) {
    v_speed = jump_height;
    is_on_ground = false; // Immediately set to false when jumping
}
```

### Collision Detection System
```gml
// Horizontal collision
if (place_meeting(x + h_speed, y, ground_layer)) {
    while (!place_meeting(x + sign(h_speed), y, ground_layer)) {
        x += sign(h_speed);
    }
    h_speed = 0;
}
x += h_speed;

// Vertical collision
if (place_meeting(x, y + v_speed, ground_layer)) {
    while (!place_meeting(x, y + sign(v_speed), ground_layer)) {
        y += sign(v_speed);
    }
    
    // Only set grounded when landing (falling downward into ground)
    if (v_speed > 0) {
        is_on_ground = true;
    }
    v_speed = 0;
} else {
    // Not touching ground, so definitely not grounded
    is_on_ground = false;
}
y += v_speed;
```

### Boundary Management System
```gml
// Step Event - Horizontal boundaries (prevent leaving sides)
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width);

// Outside Room Event (Other_0.gml) - Vertical boundary (restart on fall)
if (y > room_height) {
    room_restart();
}
```

### Sprite Management System
```gml
// Sprite flipping (following The Wizard conventions)
image_xscale = facing_direction;
```

## Key Development Decisions

### 1. Input System Design
**Decision**: Use The Wizard's variable naming conventions
**Reasoning**: Consistency with established patterns, easier code maintenance and expansion

### 2. Ground Detection Logic
**Decision**: Only set `is_on_ground = true` when falling downward into collision
**Reasoning**: Prevents infinite jumping by distinguishing between landing vs hitting ceiling

### 3. Jump State Management
**Decision**: Immediately set `is_on_ground = false` when jumping
**Reasoning**: Prevents double jumping and ensures clean state transitions

### 4. Boundary Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Clamp horizontal movement, restart room on vertical fall
**Reasoning**: 
- Horizontal: Feels like invisible walls, no death penalty
- Vertical: Standard platformer behavior for falling off screen

### 5. Physics Values Balance
**Decision**: Move speed 4, jump height -15, gravity 0.5
**Reasoning**: Provides responsive but controlled movement with good jump arc

### 6. Collision System Architecture
**Decision**: Separate horizontal and vertical collision with pixel-perfect movement
**Reasoning**: Prevents getting stuck in walls and provides smooth collision response

## Fixed Issues During Development

### 1. Ground Detection Logic Error
**Problem**: Original logic set `is_on_ground = true` for any downward movement
**Root Cause**: Missing collision context in ground state logic
**Solution**: Only set grounded when actually colliding with ground while falling
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Ground detection now properly differentiates landing vs ceiling collision

### 2. Jump State Management
**Problem**: Potential for double jumping due to improper state reset
**Root Cause**: `is_on_ground` not immediately set to false when jumping
**Solution**: Added `is_on_ground = false;` immediately when jump starts
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Clean jump state transitions

### 3. Room Boundary Handling
**Problem**: All boundaries caused death/restart
**Root Cause**: Single boundary check for all edges
**Solution**: Separate handling - clamp horizontal, restart on vertical fall
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - More user-friendly boundary behavior

### 4. Event Registration Issue
**Problem**: Outside Room event not properly registered in project file
**Root Cause**: Missing event type 7 in obj_player.yy eventList
**Solution**: Added proper event registration to GameMaker project configuration
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Outside Room event now properly triggers

### 5. Variable Optimization
**Problem**: Unnecessary intermediate variables (`h_input`, `v_input`)
**Root Cause**: Over-engineering from The Wizard patterns
**Solution**: Removed unused variables and simplified calculations
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Cleaner, more efficient code structure

## Project 2: Double Jump & Crouch System

**Purpose**: Add double jump mechanics and crouch functionality to the base platformer
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Working

### Key Features
- ✅ Double jump system (ground jump + air jump at 80% power)
- ✅ Crouch functionality with proper collision detection using "feet position tracking"
- ✅ **Platform system with drop-through functionality**
- ✅ Sprite switching between standing and crouching
- ✅ Movement speed reduction while crouching (50%)
- ✅ Jump prevention while crouching
- ✅ Auto-cancel crouch when airborne
- ✅ Smart collision checking to prevent getting stuck under low ceilings

### Variables Added (Create_0.gml)
```gml
// Double jump system
jumps_done = 0;
max_jumps = 2; // Allow double jump
can_double_jump = false;

// Crouch system
is_crouching = false;
stand_sprite = spr_player;
crouch_sprite = spr_player_crouch;

// Platform system
can_pass_through = true;
drop_cooldown = 0;
drop_delay = 15;

// Layer references
ground_layer = layer_tilemap_get_id("Ground");
platform_layer = layer_tilemap_get_id("Platforms");
```

### Controls
- **A** - Move left
- **D** - Move right  
- **W** - Jump (ground jump + double jump in air)
- **S** - Crouch (only when on ground)
- **M** - Drop through platforms (when standing on one)

### Crouch System Logic - "Feet Position Tracking" Method
```gml
// Crouching logic
if (crouch_key && is_on_ground) {
    if (!is_crouching) {
        // Store feet position before changing sprite
        var feet_position = y + sprite_height/2;
        
        is_crouching = true;
        sprite_index = crouch_sprite;
        
        // Adjust position so feet stay at same level
        y = feet_position - sprite_height/2;
    }
    h_speed = h_speed * 0.5; // Slower movement while crouching
}

// Standing up logic
else if (is_crouching) {
    // Check if there's room to stand up
    var normal_height = sprite_get_height(stand_sprite);
    var feet_position = y + sprite_height/2;
    
    if (!place_meeting(x, feet_position - normal_height, ground_layer)) {
        is_crouching = false;
        sprite_index = stand_sprite;
        
        // Adjust position so feet stay at same level
        y = feet_position - normal_height/2;
    }
}
```

### Platform System Logic - "Drop-Through Platforms"
```gml
// Platform drop-through system
if (drop_key && is_on_ground && place_meeting(x, y + 1, platform_layer)) {
    can_pass_through = false;
    drop_cooldown = drop_delay;
    v_speed = 1; // Small downward velocity to pass through
    is_on_ground = false;
}

// Platform drop cooldown management
if (drop_cooldown > 0) {
    drop_cooldown--;
    if (drop_cooldown <= 0) {
        can_pass_through = true;
    }
}

// Platform collision (only when falling down and can pass through)
if (v_speed > 0 && can_pass_through && !place_meeting(x, y, platform_layer)) {
    if (place_meeting(x, y + v_speed, platform_layer)) {
        while (!place_meeting(x, y + 1, platform_layer)) {
            y += 1;
        }
        
        is_on_ground = true;
        jumps_done = 0; // Reset jump counter when landing on platform
        v_speed = 0;
    }
}
```

### Double Jump System Logic
1. **Ground Jump**: W key + on ground → full jump height + enable double jump
2. **Air Jump**: W key + in air + double jump available → 80% jump height
3. **Reset**: Double jump resets when landing on ground

### Platform System Logic
1. **Landing on Platforms**: Can land on platforms from above when falling
2. **Jump Through**: Can jump up through platforms from below
3. **Drop Through**: M key + standing on platform → temporarily disable platform collision
4. **Cooldown System**: 15-frame cooldown prevents immediate re-landing after dropping
5. **Pass-Through State**: `can_pass_through` controls when platforms are solid vs passable

### Sprite Management
- `spr_player` (48x48px) - Standing/moving sprite
- `spr_player_crouch` (48x24px) - Crouching sprite
- Auto-flipping based on facing direction

### Crouch System Debugging History

#### Initial Issues Found and Fixed:
1. **Height Calculation Bug** ✅ FIXED
   - **Problem**: Height difference calculated inside standing-up check
   - **Solution**: Pre-calculated in CREATE event

2. **Position Adjustment Bug** ✅ FIXED  
   - **Problem**: Player moved down when crouching, causing ground sinking
   - **Solution**: Implemented "feet position tracking" from Platformer Example

3. **Ground Sinking Issue** ✅ FIXED
   - **Root Cause**: Wrong position adjustment logic pushed player into ground
   - **Solution**: Used feet position tracking instead of simple offset adjustment

#### Final Implementation Benefits:
- ✅ Feet always stay on the ground
- ✅ No sinking into ground
- ✅ No floating above ground  
- ✅ Smooth transitions between sprites
- ✅ Collision detection works properly

#### Test Cases Verified:
- ✅ Crouch on flat ground
- ✅ Stand up on flat ground  
- ✅ Try to stand under low ceiling (stays crouched)
- ✅ Jump while crouching (prevented)
- ✅ Auto-cancel crouch when airborne
- ✅ Slower movement while crouched
- ✅ Proper sprite switching

### Platform System Test Cases:
- ✅ Walk on platforms normally (solid collision from above)
- ✅ Jump up through platforms from below (passable)
- ✅ Drop through platforms with M key
- ✅ Land on platforms from above (triggers grounded state)
- ✅ Double jump works from platforms
- ✅ Crouch works on platforms
- ✅ Cooldown prevents getting stuck in platform

### Platform System Implementation Details

The drop-through platform system successfully provides full platformer functionality:

#### **Core Platform Features:**
1. **Landing on Platforms** - Player can land on platforms from above when falling, platforms act as solid ground
2. **Jump Through from Below** - Player can jump up through platforms from underneath with no collision interference
3. **Drop Through Mechanism** - M Key while standing on platform drops through with 15-frame cooldown
4. **Smart Collision Logic** - Only collides when falling down, can pass through, and not currently inside platform
5. **Integration** - Works seamlessly with double jump, crouch, and all existing systems

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Variables**: `can_pass_through`, `drop_cooldown`, `drop_delay`, `platform_layer`
- **Controls**: M key for drop-through functionality
- **Cooldown System**: 15-frame prevention of immediate re-landing
- **State Management**: Temporary disabling of platform collision during drop-through
- **Collision Logic**: Conditional platform collision based on movement direction and state

---

## Project 2 Complete: Enhanced Platformer System ✅

**Final Status**: All systems working together seamlessly
- **Base Movement**: A/D movement, gravity, collision
- **Jumping**: Ground jump + double jump with 80% power  
- **Crouching**: S key with feet position tracking, no ground sinking
- **Platforms**: Jump through from below, land from above, M key drop-through
